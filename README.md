## How To Guide


This big game block includes 16 small different blocks and makes up 8 pairs of cards. Different blocks has different pattern. The general rule is: open 2 blocks randomly and check whether they are matched.

Details:

1.Users open one card randomly, it will show its pattern and they should remember its pattern.

2.Open another card, it will show the pattern again.

3.When the second card's pattern is correspond with the first one, the color will turn to green.

4.If the second card's pattern is different with the first one, the color will turn to red and these two cards will shake for 2 seconds.

5.Once all the small blocks are matched, it will show an announcement said "Congratulations! Click OK to play again!". It means the game is over.

## Issues/Planned Changes/Roadmap

 This game drawback is these small blocks should be put them in a flexible position instead of fixed position. In this way, users can enchance their imagination and boost their interests. However, users are not able to click three small blocks toghther, because it is not this memory game's mode. In the future, this game can be added something specials, such as adding some background music when 2 small cards are matched or making some animation effect when the cards are not matched.
